Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3> Recent Projects</h3>
      <h4>Web design</h4>
      <p>
      One of my first websites is this for a rafting company 
      who was looking to offer their services to potential clients from all over the world. 
      When starting the project for the rafting company I worked on the plan for the website and 
      made the wireframe for the second page.
      I applied knowledge of HTML and CSS, changing fonts, colors, adding images and logos, and finally, 
      doing some adjusts and composition so that the page looks great and fun!
